The crypto world is building [replacements for many of our civilization's institutions](/2021/05/14/mundane-uses-of-blockchains.html). Until recently, I didn't really understand why that's something we might want. I want to try to describe this feeling before I get so deep into it that I can't remember what it felt like to be on the outside.

I think this is something that I was reluctant to admit to myself. I am definitely not the radical type who says things like "fuck the system." I'm much more of a centrist. I can see that our civilization is in some ways amazingly good, and I generally roll my eyes at the angry/ungrateful/resentful types (especially twenty-year-old politically-engaged activists/protesters) who don't understand or appreciate that.

In particular, I want to say that I am very much not on board with either the socialist/communist "profit is bad" types or the social-justice/political-correctness "America is racist/sexist/transphobic" types. I don't really want to get too deeply into those questions here; I've got a bunch of uneasiness about the current state of our civilization, but those particular criticisms seem nutty to me.

But precisely *because* I think the radical-leftist types are so nutty, it took me a long time to admit that I don't have a lot of confidence in a lot of our core institutions these days. I think it would be a massive mistake to throw out the baby with the bathwater, but I do have a growing sense of dissatisfaction.

I'm not going to go into detail here on any of these topics; each of them deserves its own post. For now, I just want to try to convey this overall feeling that I have.

  - I don't trust our government. The people who win elections are *not* our best and brightest. And more than that, we've got what Balaji Srinivasan describes as a "51% democracy": at any particular moment, nearly half the citizens hate the government.
  - Regulatory organizations like the FDA and SEC just seem horrifically broken. The FDA screwed up America's COVID-19 response pretty badly, and I've heard lots of other criticisms of it too. In general, regulation's main effect seems to be to block innovation and enshrine the current way of doing things. (Ostensibly the regulators are trying to stop wrongdoing and protect people, but there are usually better ways of doing that. Creating a bunch of bureaucratic rules mostly just gets in the way of innovators, because the rules were all designed with the old system in mind.)
  - I *really* don't trust our media outlets or newspapers or journalists in general. I think that whole area of our society is just completely full of shit. They're supposed to be our sense-making apparatus, and instead they're not much more than propaganda machines.
  - Same with our education system, really. Elementary school, high school, university... all of it. (I want to be really clear that I'm obviously not against *learning*; I'm against this specific education system that we've built.) Children are being raised by their peers instead of by adults, elementary-schools have controversial political agendas, universities are getting more and more hostile to free speech...
  - Banks... it's not that I *hate* banks - they basically do their job - but yikes, everything I do in the financial world is just pointlessly slow and expensive. For a bank, being inefficient isn't nearly as important as being trustworthy, so that was a reasonable tradeoff to make in the past. But it's aggravating, and it's no longer necessary. (I also get the impression that there are some more serious problems with our banking system, but that's something that I don't know a lot about.)
  - Big Tech companies (Twitter, Facebook, Google, Apple, etc.) seem to be getting more and more authoritarian in their approach to speech. Much more censorship now than there was before. Political bias masquerading as "fact-checking". Sometimes the people they're censoring are actually full of shit, but I've seen many important instances where they're not. And in any case, that is just *not* Twitter's job; even if I wanted there to be a society-wide Arbiter of Truth, Twitter would not be the organization I'd trust to fill that role.
  - Large organizations in general (whether it's corporations or governments)... they just have this feeling of bland fakeness.

The overall feeling I have is that America, or Canada (where I live), or Western society in general... isn't what it used to be. A whole bunch of its core institutions are failing. It feels like it's on its way down.

And it looks like what's going to *replace* it is crypto.

I'll write more about that another time. But I do want to end this post on a more positive note, because part of the reason why I was previously reluctant to accept this was because it was so depressing. So for now, I just want to say that the crypto world has an amazing amount of energy and competence and optimism and ingenuity. They are building the next iteration of our civilization, and it looks like they might be successful in making it more trustworthy and efficient and reliable and fair and transparent.
