title:  "Is censorship-resistant social-media viable?"

Whenever a new decentralized-social-media project pops up, one counterargument I keep seeing (e.g. [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/reuyix/i_created_a_decentralized_version_of_twitter/hof1vo9/)) is that people are going to clamor for the removal of illegal/sleazy content.

As far as I can tell, the pro-decentralization argument is something like:

  - Like it or not, the technology exists; people can upload whatever they want to the Internet, and in particular we now have [decentralized, permissionless data storages](https://www.reddit.com/r/Web3SocialMedia/comments/rr8cuw/decentralized_permissionless_data_storages/) where the people providing the storage space don't even know what content is being stored. Even if we wanted to somehow prevent that content from being uploaded, we couldn't.
  - There are huge dangers in allowing companies like Twitter and Facebook to become our society's moderators.
  - We can still build walled gardens, with moderators to forbid content that's against the rules. But we want *lots* of those (not a single company moderating the entire platform), and they have to be built on *top* of the censorship-resistant foundation. We can't prevent people from posting whatever illegal/sleazy stuff they want, but we *can* create a user-interface layer on top that (by default) hides it.

Still, I can imagine this being a significant hurdle to adoption, especially in the early stages, both from a legal standpoint and from a public-opinion standpoint. I don't really have any great ideas about what to do about that. Any thoughts?
