I'm a software guy with about 20 years of experience.

I spent the past 10 years working for Apple, but recently quit because it looks to me like the crypto/blockchain/web3 field is where the next iteration of our civilization is going to be built.

General views on stuff:
  - Humanity is starting to face bigger and scarier challenges. Many of them are threats to our existence.
  - Our civilization is amazingly good, and we shouldn't throw the good stuff out, but it's also extremely broken in some ways. Our current institutions are not going to be adequately competent to get us through the upcoming threats.
  - Crypto is important. It isn't just for tech nerds or financial speculators. You know how the Internet transformed everything? Crypto is going to be like that too. (The only way that doesn't happen is if something even more transformative happens first, like general AI or nuclear war.)
  - Right-wing people are fine, left-wing people are fine. Lefties who hate righties, and righties who hate lefties, are not fine. A lot of the left/right arguments will become moot after crypto anyway; this is a good time to start building something better, rather than arguing over which of our inadequate legacy institutions is the least awful.
  - Also, extremists who want to burn down our civilization are not fine. Protesting and rioting is worse than useless. It's important to point out problems with our current system, but please have the humility to build something better and *then* ask people to voluntarily switch to it. (This is exactly what the crypto world is doing.)
  - I dunno, maybe I'll write more stuff later.
