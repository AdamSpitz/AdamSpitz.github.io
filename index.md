Here's what I think about various topics:
  - [Crypto](/pages/crypto/)
    - crypto isn't stupid
      - it's not 100% scams, it's 99% scams; that 1% is hugely important
      - our current civilization is suffering terribly from a lack of trustworthy institutions; the point of crypto is that we can make computing stuff where *you can see how something works just by looking at it*
      - 
    - the tech will be good enough to match web2 plus be trustworthy
    - "haha crypto has been around for so long and hasn't found many use cases" -> no, the tech isn't done yet (still need scalability, privacy, non-terrifying wallet UX) (but the endgame is in sight)
    - Ethereum is going to win. (I'm not saying you should buy ETH; I have no idea whether the price will go up or down. I'm saying ETH is already a better store-of-value than BTC, and L2s and L3s are already better than alt-L1s like Solana.)
    - ZK tech is super-cool
      - we can let big companies run supercomputers that do huge calculations, and still verify that those calculations were done honestly
  - [AI](/pages/ai/)
    - AI is going to kill us all.
