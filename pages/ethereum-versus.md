# Ethereum versus Other Blockchains

"Ugh, there are [so many blockchains](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/layer-1). Do I really need to care about the differences between them?"

If you're reading this because you're considering putting some money into crypto or actually using some sort of blockchain-based application, then yes, for now you still need to care.

If you're reading this just because you're curious about what the heck the point is of all this crypto stuff, then the main thing that's worth understanding is that crypto isn't just about money. Bitcoin was the first blockchain, and having a decentralized digital currency is a very cool and important application of blockchains, but now we have programmable blockchains (Ethereum being the first and biggest) upon which developers can create all sorts of applications. It's like the difference between a calculator and a computer, or between an old dumb cell phone and a smartphone.

Point is, if your impression of crypto is "whatever, I don't care that much about this currency stuff"... no, it's much more than that.

But beyond that, you probably don't need to care about the differences between Ethereum and Solana and whatever.


"Okay, but still, why are there so many???"

There are major advantages to having everybody use the same blockchain, so new blockchains get started for roughly two reasons:
  1. They've got a cool new idea that is significantly better than what existing blockchains can do.
  2. Or it's a cash grab.

(And of course projects of type #2 pretend that they're type #1.)


"Okay, so which ones are which?"

Bitcoin people will tell you that Bitcoin is the *only* good one and that all others are "shitcoins". This is ridiculous for the same reason that saying "we don't need computers, a calculator is good enough" is ridiculous. (See [Ethereum versus Bitcoin](/pages/ethereum-versus-bitcoin).)

Beyond that, evaluating them gets more technical. If you're a normal person who doesn't want to get into all those details, you can just notice that Ethereum is the second one on the list (i.e. it's the biggest general-purpose one) and leave it at that.


just one application among many others; 


 Ethereum and Solana and Avalanche and lots of other blockchains are general-purpose, capable of support arbitrary applications (in the same way that a computer or a smartphone supports applications).






"Ugh. I don't care about all this tribal stuff. Do I really need to choose?"

If you're reading this because you're considering putting some money into crypto or actually using some sort of blockchain-based application, then yes, for now you still need to care.

In the long run, I doubt 


In the long run






"What are these advantages to everybody using the same blockchain?"

  - Bridges between layer1 chains are notoriously insecure.
  - 


The short version is that blockchains are capable of being a platform for general-purpose applications (not just for a currency), Ethereum was the first project to aim at this, and it's done a remarkably good job over the years of building towards that vision while staying true to the

"Why do they hate each other so much?"








(I'm definitely biased on this; I even worked briefly on an Ethereum implementation called [nimbus-eth1](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth1).)
