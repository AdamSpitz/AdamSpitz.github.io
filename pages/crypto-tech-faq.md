# Crypto Tech FAQ For Normal People

"I've been hearing about crypto for years now and nothing much has come of it."

The tech's not done yet.

In particular, here are some big things that are currently inadequate (but have solutions that are in the works):
  - Scalability: Some apps (particularly financial ones) are viable when the technology only supports 12 transactions per second and each transaction costs dollars; many more kinds of apps become viable when we have thousands/millions of transactions per second and they cost less than a penny.
  - Privacy: Everything on a blockchain is publically-visible. That's great for things that we *want* to be publically-visible, but lousy for things that we'd like to be able to keep private. There are solutions involving clever cryptography, so that we'll be able to make apps that let you do transactions that aren't visible to the whole world and yet whose validity still be *verified* by the whole world.
  



## Scalability

AAA

Right now, Ethereum can do about 12 transactions per second, and each transaction costs dollars (because transactions are basically auctioned off, so the apps that are willing to pay the most get them). That's good enough for some applications (like some financial ones), but many new applications (social media, gaming, etc.) will become viable once we can do thousands or millions of transaction per second at a cost of less than a penny.


## Privacy

AAA


## Wallets Are Terrifying

If you want to control your own crypto "wallet", the current story we tell people is: "Here is your 24-word account-recovery phrase. You must never ever lose this and never ever let anyone else see it, or you will lose all your money and there is absolutely nothing that anyone will be able to do about it." This is *terrifying*. Normal humans will (very reasonably!) not go for this. There are various projects working on friendlier solutions to this, but it's not quite ready for mass adoption yet.

All of these problems have solutions in the works. Like, not just "we have a vague idea of how we might maybe fix this", but actual projects that are currently at the testnet stage or whatever.

AARDVARK










  - the tech will be good enough to match web2 plus be trustworthy

  - ZK tech is super-cool
    - we can let big companies run supercomputers that do huge calculations, and still verify that those calculations were done honestly
