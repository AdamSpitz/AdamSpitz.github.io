# Crypto FAQ For Normal People

"Wait, I thought crypto was dead."

Um, no?


"But isn't crypto just a bunch of scams?"

It's not 100% scams, it's 95% scams! And that 5% is hugely important.

It's like investing in dotcoms back in the 1990s. Tons of bad ideas, but the few good ones changed the world.

For more detail, see my page on [Crypto Scandals, Scams, Hacks, and Just Plain Dumb Ideas](/pages/crypto-scandals/).


"Okay, what exactly are these good ideas?"

The point of crypto is that we can build stuff where *you can see how something works just by looking at it*, rather than needing to trust any particular company or government or whatever.

(That's an oversimplification; bear with me.)

Trustworthy institutions are in short supply in our civilization today.

AAA I should say more stuff here.

(And with AI coming, this might be hugely important; crypto is terrible at everything except being trustworthy, AI is great at everything except being trustworthy.)


"I don't read code. How does it help me to have the thing's code be open and readable?"

The point isn't that you, personally, are going to read the code; the point is that *computer nerds who are unaffiliated with the computer nerds who wrote the code* can read the code (to determine whether the code does what its authors say it's supposed to do).

These people are called auditors; projects in the crypto world aren't considered trustworthy if they haven't been audited. (Bugs still slip through, and that's very bad. But still, auditing is a real thing that does actually happen.)


"So this is about Open Source software?"

Not *just* that.

If Google or Facebook or Twitter tell you, "Here, we're open-sourcing the code that we run on our servers," you can go and read the code that they publish, but you still have no guarantee that the code that they *say* they're running is the code that they're *actually* running.

The whole point of a blockchain is that you can look at the code that is actually running, and you can trust the blockchain to run that code as-written.


"I still don't really see the point. I mean, I don't exactly *love* the Fed or banks or Twitter or video-game companies or whoever, but I don't think that the problem with them is that they don't do what they say they're going to do. I dislike those organizations for different reasons."

Yes, exactly! The point isn't just that we're expecting those organizations to do dishonest things; the point is that if we want to replace them, we need the replacements to be at least as trustworthy as they are.

AAA say more stuff here




"Okay, but I've been hearing about crypto for years now and nothing much has come of it."

The tech's not done yet.

See my [Crypto Tech FAQ](/pages/crypto-tech/) for more detail, but the bottom line is: cut the devs some slack. Building this stuff isn't easy. There's all sorts of progress being made all the time in many areas; it just takes time. At this point the endgame is in sight, though.

In particular, here are a few (solvable but not easy) technical problems that currently block mainstream adoption:
  - Scalability: Transactions cost dollars; many more apps become viable when transactions cost less than a penny.
  - Privacy: The point of blockchains is that we can write apps where all the activity can be verified (by anyone) as following the rules, but we also want privacy so that we can make apps where your transactions aren't just visible (to anyone). This sounds like a contradiction, but is doable with clever cryptography.
  - Wallets Are Terrifying: "Keep this 24-word account-recovery phrase secret and safe; you must never ever ever lose it or let anyone else see it, or you will lose all your money and there will be nothing that anyone can do about it."

We're not stumped on what to do about any of these; they all have solutions that are quite close to being ready. But it's taken years to get to this point.


"I heard crypto is bad for the environment."

That's no longer the case, except for Bitcoin.

The bad-for-the-environment thing is called "proof of work"; it was the first idea we had, and Bitcoin is still using it; nobody else who matters is still using it. In particular, Ethereum (the second-largest blockchain, and I suspect soon to be the largest) has already fixed this by moving to a better idea called "proof of stake". The environmental angle is a complete nonissue unless you're using Bitcoin specifically.


"So you're an Ethereum guy?"

Yeah.

You really don't want to get sucked into blockchain tribalism if you don't have to. As a layman, the only really important thing to understand is that blockchains are a general-purpose application platform; they're not just about money.

See my [Ethereum versus Other Blockchains](/pages/ethereum-versus/) page for more detail.


"Are you saying that I should buy ETH?"

No, I am really really not giving you financial advice. The technology has huge potential, but I have no idea whether the price of ETH (or anything else) will go up or down.
