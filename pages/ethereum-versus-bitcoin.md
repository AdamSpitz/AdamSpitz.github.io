# Ethereum versus Bitcoin

You shouldn't just take my word for this; I'm definitely biased (towards Ethereum), and there's a ton of tribal sniping between different blockchains. But here's what I think.

  - I have a huge amount of respect for Bitcoin; this is a shoulders-of-giants kind of thing.
  - But at this point Bitcoin doesn't really have anything going for it except for the fact that more people recognize the name (which is important). Bitcoin was brilliant, but it's obsolete, and I expect it to fade away into irrelevance fairly soon.

The big difference is that Ethereum supports a huge rich ecosystem of applications (not just currency, but also all sorts of other financial stuff, as well as social media, gaming, identity, and a bunch of other things), whereas Bitcoin isn't much more than just a currency.

It's like the difference between a calculator and a computer. Or between an old dumb cell phone and a smartphone. A whole ecosystem opens up once you have a platform capable of general-purpose computation.


"So Ethereum is a jack-of-all-trades, but Bitcoin is extra-good at its own specialized purpose of being 'digital gold'?"

Well, that's the thing. ETH-the-asset is already a better Bitcoin than Bitcoin. The whole point of Bitcoin is to be a decentralized non-inflationary currency, and ETH does a better job of this than BTC does.

The reason is basically: higher revenue, lower expenses.

  - Ethereum has much higher revenue because it supports arbitrary applications, all of which pay transaction fees in ETH.
  - And Ethereum has much lower expenses because it doesn't need to compensate the block producers for expending a crapton of electricity and hardware.

That is, ETH is *sustainably* not-inflating, because it doesn't need to keep minting a bunch of new money to make up the shortfall between its revenue and its expenses.

Whereas Bitcoin's strategy for creating a supply cap is:
  - let's pay for security in a hideously inefficient way;
  - and have low revenue because we insist on not supporting apps;
  - and since "high expenses, low revenue" would require us to issue a lot of new BTC in order to make up the difference, but we don't *want* to have high issuance because the whole Bitcoin meme is "21 million supply cap, no inflation", let's just cut our expenses by cutting our security in half every four years.


"Okay, but isn't Bitcoin more secure or more decentralized or something?"

No.

I'll write more about this some other time. But yikes, Bitcoin maximalists have some really dumb takes on this.
