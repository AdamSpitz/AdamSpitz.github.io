# Crypto Scandals, Scams, Hacks, and Just Plain Dumb Ideas

"[You say](/pages/crypto/) that crypto is a good thing, but what about the constant scandals and hacks and collapses I keep hearing about?"

Good question! Let's distinguish between different kinds of bad things, because there are quite a few and they have different causes and solutions:

  - Scams: devs are dishonest
  - Hacks: devs are honest but wrote the code wrong, leaving a hole that a bad guy could came along and steal money
  - Dumb Shit: devs are honest, code does what it's supposed to do, but what it's supposed to do is really stupid
  - Bullshit: problem has nothing to do with crypto, but media acts like it does


## Scams / rugpulls

This is where the devs promise to build something, collect a bunch of money, then run away with it.

Don't give people a lot of your money unless you trust them.


## Hacks

This is where the devs are honest, but make mistakes. Writing correct code is hard; sometimes there are bugs, and sometimes a bad guy can come along and use one of those bugs to steal money.

There are lots of examples of this.

Honest crypto projects go to great lengths to try to avoid having this kind of thing happen. There are audits (where programmers who aren't the authors of the code look over the code to try to find bugs), testnets (where they let people play with the app using play money), etc. Still, sometimes bugs slip through.

Older projects that have been around for a while and are battle-tested are usually safer. And the good news is that once the code is right, it's right. That is, the dream here is:

  - Sure, in the early days of a particular protocol, there'll be bugs. Don't put large amounts of money into a new application that hasn't been battle-tested yet.
  - But in the long run, the devs will shake all the bugs out and release a version that is *actually correct* and then we can just keep using that forever and it'll keep on working. (As opposed to an org run by humans, where just because it works today doesn't mean the people running it won't become untrustworthy tomorrow, or be pressured by the government, or whatever.)


## Dumb Shit

Here I'm thinking of Terra/LUNA (though there are plenty of other examples too).

I do think there was some [shady human misconduct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Kwon) in there, but Terra was also just a really bad idea in the first place, and there were plenty of people who [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eOU5OaKd8s](said so). The problem that eventually caused its demise was predicted by various people in advance; it wasn't a flaw in the code (the code worked the way it was supposed to), it was that its economics were designed in a dumb way. This was something that you could have figured out just by listening to what people had to say about it.

That doesn't mean we say to the people who lost money "it was your own fault"; there were suicides, and a lot of other people who got really badly burned, and that's not something to be flippant about. But that's the fundamental tradeoff with code running on blockchains:

  - We can't stop anyone from writing whatever applications they want, and we can't stop users from using those applications.
  - But at least the users can see what they're getting into and trust that the code will execute as-written.

I can't claim to have foreseen Terra's demise; before the crash, I had heard of the *name* Terra/LUNA, but I knew absolutely nothing about it beyond that. If you had asked me about it back then, that's what I would have said. And if you had asked me whether it was a good idea to put money into it, I would have said, "I wouldn't put money into something I don't understand reasonably deeply. And if you don't understand it either and haven't heard anyone you trust vouch for it, don't put in any amount of money that you can't afford to lose."


## Stuff that isn't even crypto's fault

With any sort of "crypto" project, it's important to understand which parts of it are made of code and which parts are made of humans.

e.g. FTX was a normal company run by humans. It was an exchange - that is, a business that enabled its users to trade various kinds of crypto assets (like BTC and ETH and so on). The thing that went wrong with FTX wasn't that there was some sort of flaw in BTC or ETH or whatever; the thing that went wrong with FTX was that the humans running it did shady things that they weren't supposed to be allowed to do (lending out its users' assets).

This is exactly the problem that crypto *fixes*. For example, contrast FTX with another project called [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/), which is a *decentralized* exchange - like FTX, it enables its users to trade various kinds of crypto assets, but instead of being made of humans, it is (mostly) made of code. You can look at the code for Uniswap and see that it just *cannot* do the bad thing that FTX did, because there is just nothing in its code that does that.

That's the story with most of the scandals the news keeps telling you about.
